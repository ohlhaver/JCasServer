# This is the Rackup initialization script for running RubyCAS-Server under Passenger/Rack.
#
# This file doesn't really have anything to do with your server's "configuration",
# and you almost certainly don't need to modify it. Instead, a config file should
# have been created for you (probably under /etc/rubycas-server/config.yml) -- this
# is the file you'll want to modify. If for some reason the configuration file
# was not created for you, have a look at the config.example.yml template and
# go from there.
